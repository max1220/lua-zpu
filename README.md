# lua-zpu

A simple emulator for the ZPU. 
Currently not complete.

Based on https://github.com/vifino/lua-cpuemus.

The goal is to create a small and readable implementation of the ZPU,
some basic peripherals, and to provide a toolchain for the emulated ZPU.

It's primary target is LuaJIT, but fallback implementations are always provided.
